# StatePopulations
Displays the United States of America. Each state can have it's DGP, Population, and GDP per capita displayed for various years. Groups of states can be selected as well.

The backend is uses .NET 6.0 and MS SQL Server. The front end uses Angular 12.

I've just started on this. It's still in progress.

Azure app services doesn't currently support .NET 6 RC1, so this site is currently down.
See it in action at https://statepopulations.azurewebsites.net/.
